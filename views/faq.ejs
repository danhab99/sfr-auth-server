<h3>How do I add a ruqqus platform to Scroll For Ruqqus?</h3>

<p>
  Register or login to your account. Then click "Edit my app". Finally find the redirect url for your entry and add it to your Redirect Sites in your ruqqus settings.
</p>

<h3>I own a ruqqus platform and I don't want this app to use my platform. How do I stop it?</h3>

<p>
  Client ID's are publicly avaliable. To remove your platform from you'll have to delete the app from your database yourself using the Client ID. After you do that, the next time someone tries to login with that Client ID, the entry will be automatically deleted and not avaliable for future use. Also for your automation needs, you can monitor <a href="https://<%= process.env.DOMAIN %>/sites">https://<%= process.env.DOMAIN %>/sites</a> to see if your platform gets added, and you can stay mindful of the <code>X-AUTH-SERVER</code> header this server includes in any <code>/auth/grant</code> request.
</p>

<h3>I have security conserns!</h3>

<p>
  So yes there will be a moment with an access token to your account will exist in the server's memory. The only thing I can do for you is promise that no logs are being taken. For more information, please review the <a href="https://github.com/danhab99/sfr-auth-server/">source code</a> and make your own informed decision. 
</p>

<h3>How do I use this Auth Server?</h3>

<p>
  I'm not going to document this api too deeply because I'm lazy (if you want to add docs, submit a pull request <a href="https://github.com/danhab99/sfr-auth-server/pulls">here</a>). Basically <a href="https://<%= process.env.DOMAIN %>/sites">https://<%= process.env.DOMAIN %>/sites</a> returns a JSON array of avaliable platforms. Then you can do <code><a href="https://<%= process.env.DOMAIN %>/{_id}">https://<%= process.env.DOMAIN %>/{_id}</a></code> to get the redierct link to your ruqqus login page and it will proceed from there.
</p>

<h3>I run a ruqqus platform but Scroll For Ruqqus isn't working for me?</h3>

<p>
  Scroll for ruqqus targets the api version of <a href="https://ruqqus.com">ruqqus.com</a>, please be sure your platform uses the same running version as them.
